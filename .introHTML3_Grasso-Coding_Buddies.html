    Hi, my name is Dawn Grasso.  I grew up in a small town in New Jersey. I went to college in Pennsylvania and lived in several other cities before moving to Atlanta, Georgia. I have lived in Georgia for over 30 years.  I have worked in the healthcare field for most of my adult life.  For the past 26 years, I have worked for several medical software companies.   I currently work as a program manager on our onboarding team.   When I am not working or taking classes, I enjoy reading, cooking, and baking.  I do not have any prior experience in web design and development.  I look forward to learning how to design my own professional website this semester.  I am working on my master’s degree in Learning Technologies and Design. My goal is to graduate with both a master’s degree and a Teaching College Graduate Certificate in the summer of 2023.
