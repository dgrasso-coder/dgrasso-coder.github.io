    <h2>Welcome </h2>
   <p> My name is Dawn Grasso, and I am pursuing my master’s degree in Learning Technologies and Design.  I welcome you to navigate through my professional 
       portfolio to see examples of my work and the knowledge gained throughout my time at the University of Missouri. 
<br><br>
     <h2>Purpose </h2>
        The purpose of this portfolio website is to help create my professional brand.  In addition, to provide a more personalized view into my educational 
        and professional background and experience.  The goal of my portfolio is to provide a space where I can showcase examples of what I have learned in 
        various courses as well as the work I have accomplished throughout my time at the University of Missouri. Finally, the objective of my portfolio is 
        to align the competencies associated with my master’s degree in Learning Technologies and Design with projects and assignments I have completed 
        throughout my time at the University of Missouri.
