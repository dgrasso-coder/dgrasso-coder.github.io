    <h2>Reflection </h2>

<main>
    
   <p>As far back as I can remember I have loved to learn new things. So, it did not surprise me when I found a project I created at the end of 
       kindergarten, titled ‘All About Me,’ validating why I will forever consider myself a lifelong student. In the project, my five-year-old 
       self discussed her desire to learn more, to keep discovering new things. That desire to challenge me endured as the years went on and has 
       pushed me to strive toward continued growth both personally and professionally. The ambition to deepen my understanding of my field as well as 
       to expose myself to new trends and tools in the industry has inspired me to pursue a Master of Science degree in Learning Technologies and Design 
       and a Graduate Certificate in Teaching College.
<br><br>
     <p><div class="a"> 
       Throughout my 20+ year career in this field, I have been responsible for the vision and execution of onboarding training systems. My goals in 
       that time have been twofold: to improve the efficiency and performance of the adult end user as well as to ensure successful business outcomes. 
       I have led instructional design teams through the development process and implementation of new training programs to achieve these results. 
       Throughout this process, my organization and goal-oriented skills have assisted me in my pursuit to acquire new instructional design strategies. 
       I have also aimed to expand my team leadership experience by mentoring new instructional designers as they work through the development and 
       delivery of onboarding training initiatives.

     <p><div class="a">  
       The Master of Science degree in Learning Technologies and Design and Graduate Certificate in Teaching College emphasis at the University of 
       Missouri is the perfect fit for me as they provided the flexibility to earn a degree online while maintaining a full-time job in the field. The 
       reputation and recognition the University of Missouri has received, being hailed as one of the best degree programs in the field among others, 
       drove me to apply to the Learning Technologies and Design program as well as the College Teaching Graduate Certificate emphasis. The courses 
       offered within each program, the ease of adding additional certificates to my degree, the fact that I will develop a portfolio of my work 
       throughout the program, and the future opportunities that might present themselves are additional reasons I was drawn to UM.

       As I shared at the start, I am a lifelong student and with the support of my family I have had the chance to broaden the knowledge and skills I can bring to my 
       current role, as well as the potential to improve my development toolkit and explore opportunities for future career growth.  This degree has presented me with 
       the ability to mentor and pass on the skills and experiences I have learned from those that I admire in the Learning and Technologies 
       field and motivates me to further my education. For that I will be forever grateful!
