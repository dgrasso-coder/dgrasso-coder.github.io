  <h2><a id="Goal_A">Design and Development of Learning Systems.</a></h2>
 
    <p> Goal: To provide students with experiences to develop theory-grounded and research-based competencies for the innovative, aesthetic, 
        effective and sustainable design/development and management of technologies for learning opportunities and systems.</p>
    <p> Description: Designing Games for Learning Gaming Blog. Each student in this course was required to create a gaming blog.  The purpose of the 
        blog was to catalog the assignments and progress throughout the course and provide a mechanism for each student to share their work. I started 
        the course with very little gaming experience.  Throughout the course, I learned key aspects of gameplay, game design, game mechanics, and 
        game elements. Three of my three biggest takeaways from the course were: how to design a game; how to document the requirements of a game 
        design; and how to enhance storytelling in game design.  My progress throughout the course is captured in my gaming blog. </p>
 
     <p> Reflection: One accomplishment that I am most proud of is the game scene I was able to develop for our final project.  I had significant 
         challenges with the gaming tool, Construct 3, when we were first introduced to it however with time and much support from my 
         classmates and instructors, I was able to create my final project scene. </p>

   <h2><a id="Goal_B">Front-End Analysis and System Evaluation.</a></h2>   
  
   <p> Goal: To provide students with experiences to develop skills in data collection, analysis, and evaluation for reflecting on and applying 
       to the design/development of learning opportunities and systems.</p>
   <p> Description: Project Management Final Project.  Our final group project was to develop an online course that would summarize the key project 
       management concepts we learned throughout the semester. Throughout the Project Management course, we learned the key elements of project 
       management, the common challenges project managers experience as well as the qualities and skills that successful project managers need to 
       possess. Our Project Management site provided us with the collaboration tool for us to complete our final project. Three of my three biggest 
       takeaways from the course were: the importance of a work breakdown structure; how to build a project plan; and how to manage the project 
       deliverables in a collaborative environment. Our final project progress is captured on the Project Management site.  </p>
        
   <p> Reflection: I am most proud of how well we worked as a team on our final group project. We developed Work Breakdown structures, identified key 
       project deliverables, and how to break down projects into milestones and mini deliverables to mitigate the risk of long, extensive timelines 
       that lacked successful outcomes. We explored one project management tool extensively and used that tool to develop our project plans, which 
       included resource allocation, budget, and ways to identify project risks and strategies to mitigate risks.  </p>

   <h2><a id="Goal_C">Leadership & Social Responsibility.</a></h2>           
   
    <p> Goal: To provide students with experiences to become socially responsible, reflective/sensitive on the interaction of technologies & 
        society, and act ethically in response to current and future challenges of emerging technologies for learning.</p>
    <p> Description: Teaching Online Courses Final Project.  Our final project in Teaching Online Courses was to develop a Synchronous Instructional 
        Session.  The purpose of the session was to instruct students on how to analyze specific travel options to plan their budget for an international 
        trip. Students were granted access to the Google site before class and all resources were linked through the Google site. The students listened 
        to a brief presentation on London travel options, budgeting tips, and tricks, and how to plan travel expenses to provide them with context on 
        the city they were planning a trip to and how the budget calculator template worked so that they could monitor their travel expenses as they 
        progressed through the lesson activity. The lesson activity included students working in pairs to create their travel budgets and assisting 
        each other in critical thinking strategies when using the budget calculator to plan their trip's budget.  I felt working in pairs would provide 
        students the opportunity to share how they were evaluating various expenses and how they evaluated the various expense types to determine their 
        final selections. </p>
        
    <p> Reflection: I really enjoyed developing and conducting this final project.  I wanted to use this opportunity to not only teach practical skills 
        such as budgeting and planning but also life skills that could benefit the students far beyond taking this course.  All too often students 
        learn the mechanics or basic elements of a single topic.  I used this project as an opportunity to introduce them to key problem-solving, 
        decision-making, and critical thinking concepts they could apply throughout their lives. </p>
