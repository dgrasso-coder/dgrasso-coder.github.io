    <h2>Personal Reflection </h2>
   <p>As far back as I can remember I have loved to learn new things. So, it did not surprise me when I found a project I created at the end of 
       kindergarten, titled ‘All About Me,’ validating why I will forever consider myself a lifelong student. In the project, my five-year-old 
       self discussed her desire to learn more, to keep discovering new things. That desire to challenge me endured as the years went on and has 
       pushed me to strive toward continued growth both personally and professionally. The ambition to deepen my understanding of my field as well as 
       to expose myself to new trends and tools in the industry has inspired me to pursue a Master of Science degree in Learning Technologies and Design 
       and a Graduate Certificate in Teaching College.

    The purpose of this portfolio website is to help create my professional brand.  In addition, to provide a more personalized view into my educational and professional background and experience.  The goal of my portfolio is to provide a space where I can showcase examples of what I have learned in various courses as well as the work I have accomplished throughout my time at the University of Missouri. Finally, the objective of my portfolio is to align the competencies associated with my master’s degree in Learning Technologies and Design with projects and assignments I have completed throughout my time at the University of Missouri.
